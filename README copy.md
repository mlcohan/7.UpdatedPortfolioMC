I utilized the Bootstrap templetes to help me create a navbar, a card, a form and responsiveness. 

There are three html files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`

    Each page has a consistent navbar with my name large and responsive links to to all 3 pages, including the current page. 
    When the page is viewed at different sizes, the navbar and content responds.
